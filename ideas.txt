Create globals for
---------------------------
lead amount/importance
enemy units (miners vs attackers)
friendly attackers (existing vs targeting)

Macro
-----
Figure out when to build labs, watchtowers
Use global lead info for macro decisions

Soldier
-------
Micro:
Complicated

Targeting:
Use friendly + enemy heatmaps
Try to capture more space in general
Prioritize lead heavy regions

Sage
-----
Micro:
Stay out of soldier range
Retreat on cd
Try to shoot from low rubble
Go back to heal if low hp (priority over soldier)

Targeting:
Same as soldiers

Watchtower
-----------
Figure out if even playable; if so when

Micro:
Place diagonally to be permeable.
Switch to turret if area sufficiently safe
Capturing a rank --- back watchtowers move forward,
one-by-one, from outside to inside.

Targeting:
Prioritize permanent high value areas

Miner
-----
Micro:
Optimize locally for efficient mining
Retreat from enemy soldiers
Mine moving away from archon
If mining in risky area, clear out deposits
If low hp, return to safe area and blow up

Targeting:
Use lead importance
Prioritize closer to home

Misc
-----
Deal with anomalies
Figure out symmetry
