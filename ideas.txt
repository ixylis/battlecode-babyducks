Macro:
1) (a) Store lead locs globally.
   (b) Route miners towards deposits.
2) Soldiers should explore instead of miners, miners should just mine.
3) Soldiers should go towards contested lead depos instead of archons

Miner micro:
Miners should mine the last lead if it's under enemy control.
Miners should retreat if attacked and no friendly soldiers around

Soldier micro:
(1) While holding, low HP soldiers should retreat and high HP soldiers should advance

if 1v1 vs enemy soldier, always go on the offense unless on lowground
